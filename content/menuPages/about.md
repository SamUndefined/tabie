title: About

When I was in second grade I went to an assembly at the high school near us. The assembly was for an author who wanted to tell her story on why and how she got into writing. Not too long after, I made my first story about four kids and a haunted house. 

It was a page long and really wasn’t that impressive. But I was proud of it and I gave it to my older sister (who designed this website). 

Anyways, ever since then I’ve been writing. 

I don’t do it every day, in fact, I can go months without writing a story but I always come back to it. It’s not just a safety net but also a comforting experience; it’s stress relieving and the feeling of creating something new is unlike anything else. 

I love reading too! And some of my favorite short stories have actually been things I wrote. Which may sound conceded but I haven’t read too many short stories. Plus, I know how hard I worked on them and it’s okay to be proud of yourself for that.

One of my childhood goals was to be a journalist but it turns out that grammar is complex and I don’t enjoy giving much thought to how my sentences are structured. I love writing from the heart, without all the filters.

So, this is one major reason why I have made a blog (with my sister’s talented developer skills). 

My other reason being, I love to spread my knowledge with others! I have GAD and some other health issues and because of it, I’ve learned so much not just about anxiety but mental health as a whole. 

I went to college (for a semester) and was majoring in psychology which helped lead me to an old passion of mine, social media. Specifically, to Youtube which I discovered when I was fourteen(2012). 

 I’ve never been into school or book knowledge, in general. I have had a couple of roadblocks in the way that have prevented it from being a fun or pleasant experience but I have always been very creative and imaginative. It’s what I feel I’m good at and comfortable with!

So, taking all of these things I love only made sense to start taking action! Not just dreaming about it but really pursuing it and giving it all I’ve got!

In conclusion, I am a  21 year old, Youtuber and blogger (or I’m trying to be:) at least) who doesn’t have everything figured out just yet but that’s okay! I know the direction I want to go in :) I love writing/reading, filming/photography, informing, helping, inspiring and creating!

 I hope you’ll find something useful or even just entertaining while you’re here :) after all, it’s made by someone who’s just having fun and spreading (hopefully) awareness to all things mental health and so much more! 

Some things I didn't mention above:

Hi! My name is Tabatha but you can call me Tabie! I have an adorable puppy named Maple! I love all animals except hyenas(They're creepy..) and all things Halloween! My birthday is October 27th and I was born in California (I've been dreaming about the day I get to go back home, since I was like 3(Aka year 2000ish)). I'm all about spirituality and expressing yourself (with respect and love for others & yourself). I live for a good fantasy book and a hero show with an optimistic personality(any good suggests? shoot me an email:)!)  I love My Hero Academia, Harry Potter, Yugioh(don't judge me!), The Flash, Spiderman(homecoming), How To Train Your Dragon(I just love dragons! But I hate ending of any kind. I'm weak lol), Doctor Who(Matt Smith's the best), and Youtubers(of course) like Kalyn Nicholson(motivational), The Fray Life and Alix Traeger(who's literally like my spirit animal). I love Violins and I'm trying to learn piano but it's a journey.

I hope to someday be a blogger, Youtuber, author, and own my own online store full of autumny coziness! I would love to travel the world with Maple(a 9 month old Blue Heeler Mix). 

Okay, I think I've rambled for far to long! I will leave you here but I hope you have a wonderful day! :)
