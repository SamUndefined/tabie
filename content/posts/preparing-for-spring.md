Beautiful blooming flowers, Short freely growing grass, gorgeous weather and... bugs?



It’s true that nothing is perfect but that doesn’t mean they aren’t close to it. And I think that Spring is one of those things.



When winter comes around we tend to find ourselves more indoors. But when Spring comes we’re reminded of the natural beauty all around us. Here are some tips you can start to do are now to prepare for Spring.

\    1.  **Bring out the light cardigans and the t-shirts** 

 With the weather warming up you soon won’t need all the lays on. So, don’t forget to slowly push away the winter clothes and wearing something comfortable and flexible instead.



\    2.   **Bring the outdoors indoors** 

\    By taking some plants inside it not only gives us a little responsibility so, we’re not in bed all day but it also reminds us of the cycle of nature that is soon to surface.

\    

\    3.   **Spring cleaning**

\    We don’t always enjoy it but cleaning gives out not only a workout but a fresh start. So, just like the trees shed their leaves and start a new one we should do the same and clean a few posts in our home that might be overlooked otherwise.



\    4.   **With warm fresh air what better way to appreciate it than to start a new routine**

\    Soon, the sidewalks will be safe from ice and a morning or nighttime run my do us some good. We all know that looking at a screen or simply doing the same thing just isn’t healthy. With a new season on the way what better time than to change things up a bit. I’m sure your dog would love a nice walk. Or maybe even a change of routine like drinking water instead of coffee in the morning or showering after you eat. Whatever it may be a new season is always a good excuse to change a routine up a little.
