Two years ago, I took a chance on moving halfway across the country. I had a home (though it wasn’t ideal), I had my close friends and a job I loved. But that still didn’t stop me. I wanted to grow mentally and really go after my dream job. Youtube and writing and owning an online store. 

The flight over here was beyond stressful. The first flight had so much turbulence even the flight attendants were taking off guard and the second flight was full of tears and fear. 

Though, it wasn’t easy I knew I wouldn’t be alone, not completely. I had my kind sister and her wonderful friends to help me with the transition. Nevertheless, it was difficult mentally and physically. I loved being around my family I’ve always felt this comfort around them but I knew it was the best for everyone to leave for now. 

About a year later, I posted my first Youtube video on my new channel. Though, it was time-consuming and very different than my usual hobbies...Netflix, Youtube, and occasionally writing or reading, I enjoyed the process nonetheless. 

Fast forward another year, to the present day, I can still say I’m proud of myself for moving and starting Youtube. I’m still am not consist but I’m definitely proud of how much effort I’ve put into each video I have uploaded. Though they aren’t to the standard I’d enjoy quite yet, I still feel accomplished with each videos creativity. Not to mention other aspects of my life that have also changed. Like taking a break from working. Also, playing and cuddling with a super cute Blue Healer mix named Maple. <3(btw I spent 3 hours coming up with that name so no judgment allowed)



Change and really, truly, going all out for what you believe is not only best for you and those around you but unfortunately, what you want can be difficult at first. We all have the questions:  What if I fail? How would I even start? Am I truly capable of doing this? What would others think? Is this really want I want? Is it what I need right now? 



Well….

In the article The Power of One Year: How 16 People Turned Theirs Lives Around in 12 months or Less by Heidi Priebe(Linked below) there’s one in particular that caught my eye.

According to the article by Heidi Priebe, an interviewee named Jessica had  “...the WORST office job imaginable.” So, she took a leap. “HUGE risk and decided to quit to pursue my dream of opening a bakery.” Said Jessica in the interview. She goes on to state that she did open her own bakery with a friend and has had success with many ups and downs along the way of course.

“Don’t worry about failures, worry about the chances you miss when you don’t even try”-Jack Canfield



I may not be where I want to be but I’m grateful for all I have right at this moment. And to just think about it… I wouldn’t be here if I hadn’t taken that leap of faith two years ago.



I hope that this motivates you into doing something new whether it’s small like changing your coffee order or going full out on some warm chai tea instead or maybe something much bigger like finishing that degree or even searching for a new job with new perspectives. (Amateur advice: keep your current job until you get an offer that you enjoy so you won’t be stressed about bills.)



Here are some more stories about others trying something new 

I hope you enjoy them
