Here’s a piece of what I wrote, in one of my stories, during a time when I was depressed and anxious. 

**\*trigger warning\* possibly?**

The cool and warm tones reflected off the ocean waters. Harsh waves came every few seconds, pushing my legs further away from the ocean edge. I traced the bubbles from the water with my eyes, watching them sink into the sand beneath my feet. There wasn’t a person in sight as I stood in the cool night. 

After many minutes of embracing the ocean air that surrounded me, I turned to see a lively city. Cars, people, bright signs, big palm trees, and the perfect artificially lit-up sky to make that night almost, breathtaking. To any ‘normal person,’ that moment would have been perfect. 

But to me, it seemed almost numbing, boring in fact. An immense amount of pure and utter boredom suspended over me. Well, it was always there but in the nights like this, peaceful and silent ones, like this, it’s easily more noticeable.

Disclaimer 1: I feel the need to explain myself. This topic reminded me of this opening scene and in a way sets the mood. Also, I couldn’t find a quote or poem that really spoke to me. I left out the really triggering part out. Since we’re talking about mental health today it didn’t seem that appropriate. 

Disclaimer 2: There’s a deep moral to this story. I wanted this opening scene and title to display that. 

Fiduciam is Latin and I promise it’s not some random Latin word. Latin culture comes up in the story. And those are the only spoilers I’ll give. _hehe_

Now, we all get anxiety at some point in time. Also, most people will experience an anxiety attack and a panic attack at some point in their life. But do you know the difference between them though?

Most don’t. Most people use them interchangeably; which can cause complications like miss diagnosis, treatment, and even a longer recovery period.

Let’s start off with anxiety. Anxiety, as you well know, is when you experience excessive worry. 

Experiencing anxiety: This can be for something during or right before an event or competition or something similar. 

Now anxiety that lasts for a longer time could lead to an anxiety disorder.

Anxiety disorders can mean a few things and affect different parts and chemicals in the brain.

Here are some Anxiety disorders:

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

Panic Disorder

Social Anxiety

Separation Anxiety Disorder

Agoraphobia

Selective Mutism

Anxiety disorder from medications

Anxiety disorder due to substance abuse

And… Unspecified and specified anxiety disorder (AKA you don’t have Munchausen Syndrome but we don’t know what it is)

_Munchausen Syndrome is someone who exaggerates or makes up their illness_

Since we’re only talking about GAD and Panic Disorder today we’ll leave the others there for another later blog post.

GAD is basically when you feel anxiety half or more than half the time. (Of course, there’s a lot more to it but I’m only giving what you need to know for differentiating the two.)

Anxiety Attacks are one common symptom of GAD but you can have anxiety attacks without having GAD. The same goes for panic attacks; you don’t need to have Panic Disorder to have a panic attack.

An Anxiety attack is a provoke reaction. For example, Jim had to do a presentation. This caused Jim to have an Anxiety Attack.

Anxiety attacks may not always have a clear stressor. Sometimes it’s multiple things and is the ‘topping on the cake’ kind of reaction. But the main things you need to know to fully understand the difference between an anxiety attack and a panic attack are: Anxiety attacks are provoked, they have a cause or perhaps causes, they can last for as long as you think about the stressor or think about the attack or for as long as the stressor exists, and the chemical that is released in the body is called **_cortisol._** I think it’s important to mention that Gaba(receptors in the neuron) are probably lacking during an attack and in someone who has an anxiety disorder. (ex. GAD)

Panic disorder is when you experience frequent panic attacks and have fear of when the next one will come.

Panic attacks are less common. However, it is likely that each person will experience at least one at some point in their life.

Panic attacks do not have a stressor. They are completely unpredictable and do not last for more than twenty minutes. (typically they last 10-20 minutes) It isn’t uncommon to experience multiple panic attack after another making it seem much longer but there is a ‘recovery period’ between the panic attacks. This ‘recovery period’ can be just a few short minutes to hours. The chemical released through your body during a panic attack is **_adrenaline._** 

So, we know a little bit about what causes each one. At least as much as we know so far...Now let's see the differences and similarities in symptoms.

**Panic Attacks:**

fear of losing control or death

chills 

hot flashes

fatigue

cramping

sweatiness

headaches

dizziness/lightheadedness/faint feeling

Numb or tingling sensation

Feeling of detachment or an ‘out of body’ feeling

trembling or shaking

nausea 

Chest pain

Tightness in throat or loss of breathe

rapid heart rate

Lack of concentration

nausea

hyperventilation

Stuttering (this is a symptom I have for both mostly during panic attacks. but can’t find any official website stating that it’s a symptom. However I feel this is important to note because I don’t have a stutter)

**Anxiety Attacks:**

irritability

restless/ unwanted thoughts

fatigue

sweatiness

fear

excessive worry

palpitations

trembling

nausea

tightness in chest

headaches

the feeling of impending doom

loss of sleep

hypervigilance

excessive crying

I just want to state that I added in stutter due to my personal experience. I tend to get a stutter during both but the stuttering is much more prominent during panic attacks. Usually, to the point to where I can only get out repeated syllables do to this (stutter) and other symptoms making it VERY difficult to talk, let alone think.

Panic attacks are different from anxiety attacks. Again, this is EXTREMELY important to know because it can help others, shorten your recovery time, and quicken your diagnosis. So, please use caution when talking about these because it can easily be miss leading and cause other problems prolonging yours or/and others recovery.

Also, please remember that just because they’re different doesn’t mean that one is more important than the other. They both are difficult and by no means fun. Anxiety attacks are just as valid as panic attacks are. So, don’t be afraid to use either term and properly!
