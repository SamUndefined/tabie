  I'm not sure why I'm awake..it's four am and I just can't seem to sleep. This
  tends to happen when I get stressed or nervous. Anyway, I figured why not
  write down what thoughts I have late at night. Maybe I'll be able to sleep
  after this.....we'll see.

  **. . .**

We’re taught not to lie, to obey the law, to obey your guardian, to be who we are. To be who we are with pride because no one else is or will ever be you.

These are all things we each agree on, correct? We should be ourselves, we shouldn’t lie or disobey. 

But if you were to say, go into an interview you’d break two of those. For example, no library wants a loud librarian. We don’t want a childish doctor or nerdy artist. When you go into an interview you NEED to look the part, act the part and all around BE the part. 

Which makes sense when you think about it. Yet, how is it we’re taught to be ourselves when 40+ hours a week, we aren’t allowed to be?

Yeah, your delivery guy might be loud or shy but does that mean he’s bad at his job?

Someone who has anxiety can’t work in a fast-environment, not because they think they can’t but because the employer never gave them a chance.

OR maybe someone with GAD, IBS or high functioning depression is forced threw tears, anxiety attacks, and physical pain when at work because “they are treatable conditions” not curable though!

I’ve witnessed, too many times, someone throwing up and walking to class. Too many times someone gives a presentation after a sleepless night. So many times someone has had to suffer through headaches, chest pains, tears for hours on end just to feed themselves. Yet, their health and mental illness STILL falls deeper do to it. And we're expected just to keep walking through it despite everything in your body telling you otherwise. Why exactly?



Oh right, because at the end of the day it’s not about you. You don’t matter to those who make a decent buck. That’s all. At the end of the day, it’s because the guy in charge doesn’t care about you at all, it’s all about how much he can make. 

He has a 2016 Chevrolet Cruze out back but he wants a Telsa Model S, not because it’s environmentally beneficial compared to the Cruz but because his neighbor just bought one last month and god forbid he let his Ph.D. certified neighbor look better than him. 





…



 

I cannot begin to tell you how many times I’ve cried over a customer talking to me as if I were less than them.

At least twice a week we would get a call from a hospital telling us that we’re the ones who messed up despite them giving us the wrong number not once, not even twice in one phone call. 



It’s so easy to blame someone else.



In most cases, it’s not even about you when someone treats you like dirt.



 They also do get paid enough, their boss also doesn’t pay them for overtime. The only difference is your severing them in some way or another which means (in their heads) they can act the same towards you that their boss does to them. Despite the “golden rule”. Which means they had to of broke at least three morals that we were all taught.





But...That’s just how the world works. So, just suffer through life and maybe someday  ‘big brother’ will change. Once EVERYONE throws a fit, of course. Because to them, the system works… I mean, you should see their paychecks. You’re thinking about what else you can afford for food and they think about what Apply product they want next.



But, here’s a thought that most of us don’t quite understand. I know I don’t, but it’s better than the system we have now. Instead of there being one man in charge maybe, just maybe, if we have us(the workers) all be in charge then no one is getting more $$ than the next person. AND! My personal favorite, we do our work equally without someone on a high chair telling us we’re not doing it right.



Now I’m sure you figured out what I’m talking about but just in case you haven’t. I’m thinking about socialism.  



Maybe afterward those with mental health or illnesses that aren’t life-threatening can have the compassion they deserve.



Not to be pessimistic and say that we’re not close to thinking of a better system. As Suzy Kassem once said, “Stand up for what is right. No matter who is committing wrong”. 



I don’t know about you but I’m done tearing myself apart for someone else’s selfish dream. Don’t get me gone shoot for the life you want but consider those around you and don’t give me the excuse, “that’s just how life works”. We made society like this, our system like this and we change anytime in any direction as we damn well, please.
