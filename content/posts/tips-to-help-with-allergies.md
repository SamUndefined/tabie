Allergies are painful and inconvenient. Around 8 percent of the United States have hay fever. There is the obvious option such as taking a pill or getting surgery but I’d like to introduce some home remedies that have helped me deal with mine. 



Tea Tree oil with hot water	

	

Instructions: Get a saucepan and fill it with a couple of cups of water and drop about 6-9 drops of Tea Tree Oil. Then smell the steam from your nose. 

Now I do have to admit that this is a little painful but It by far my favorite so far. Unfortunately, it is very temporary and everyone has a slightly different experience. Some people can go hours after with now stuffy nose and others may only have a few minutes or so. 



A saltwater spray 



Instructions: Spray cold salt water in your nose. You can find these spray bottles at any convenient store. 

The few people I know who have tried this, including myself have a slight stinging sensation that lasts only a few seconds but do see results shortly after. I personally use Nasal-Spray. You can also mix 1 cup of lukewarm (clean by boil or use distilled) water with a ½ teaspoon of salt.



Use coconut oil before bed and when you wake up



Instructions: Take a Q-tip, dip it into coconut oil, and rub it lightly around the inside of your nose.

This will help prevent any cracking and dry skin. It might take a week or so to see or feel a difference but if you get bloody noses often I’d encourage you to try this tip out.



Changing out the home air filter



We don’t always think about how helpful this can be. But it’s small things that can truly add up. I’m by no means an expert on this topic but I’d suggest that you talk to your landlord or whoever to find out how often you should be changing out your filter. For example, My roommate and I need to change our out every three months.

Filters only cost a few bucks and need to be replaced frequently anyway and this might just give you the motivation you need to cross off this chore.
