When you’re pushed up against a wall your acute stress (fight or flight) response kicks in. That’s basically where I’m at in life at the moment.

We all do this at least once in our lives. It’s when you have a problem put forth and even though it’s important and there’s probably a little urgency in it, we push it away. Far far away. Some of us go to grave lengths to keep from making a decision.

Today is better than any other day to start facing things that we KNOW are going to be hard. But why not today? The problems you push away are going to keep building and building up until you decide to face them head-on. Everyone gets scared. But it’s time to let your beliefs take hold of what's in important.

Since I was young, much like over 40 million of us and probably you at some point in your life, have felt hunger. Have been stressed to the point it PHYSICALLY HURTS

Last year my little brother was in cardiac arrest from a panic attack. People with IBS, and “medical conditions” usually have begun from stress that causes your body to malfunction in a sense. And it’s articles such as http://www.jkp.com/jkpblog/2012/06/article-dr-sandra-scheinbaum-6-myths-about-panic-attacks/ that masks such things. 

These two contributors(avoiding the problem and masking it) help us overall to not progress in things that are necessary such as unemployment, world hunger, mental illness, homelessness, etc…

Which is anything to be ashamed of but when will we learn to take action?

What do you need to lose?

Aren’t you tired of your 9-5 low paid mediocre job….life?

Yes, we are slowly getting somewhere and I know my roommate would think that this is enough and should comfort us but is that what we should tell our future generations? Is that what you would want to hear if you were literally starving to death today? As you read this article...probably disagree mostly.

I will never be able to grow up without fearing the next meal, my family, depression, bullying, and so much more. Saying “yeah, someday” isn’t good enough anymore.

Do you know how many charities are actually giving 100% proceeds to their cause?

Not enough. 

Look, instead of saying someday or tomorrow why not say today?

When will we get the hint? It’s not about someday. It should be TODAY!

Too many people have given up on society. Too many times have we turned a blind eye. 

What will you do today to change tomorrow?

MY STORY:

I lost my job, didn’t qualify for unemployment (here’s the story on that https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYJUWAid0wsbsvqt_XYevww?view_as=subscriber)

Owe over 2,000 so far, can’t seem to get a job(even though it’ll probably put me into a depression), don’t have enough money to fix my car let alone worry about my next meal. My dogs next meal!

Don’t let my story be yours. Learn from others before it’s too late.

I’m writing this with a lot of emotion because I want you to feel a bit how I do right now in time so you can get up and make your story different than mine. So I will not be editing this and I know the grammar is worse than usual. You can send me an email at   

tabiealissa@gmail.com if you notice anything to the point where it doesn’t make sense.

Thank you for taking the time to read this but I truly hope this motivated you to acted today. Much like my shirt says “ be the change you wish to see in the world” -Gandi

If you're looking for a good song sort of on this topic. I'd recommend Cycle Of Life from Lion King. while I was working on a description for a similar video this started playing and it made me think of this again. It's funny how LOA works.
