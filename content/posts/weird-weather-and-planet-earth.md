Did you know that 2018 has been the hottest year yet?





The past few months have been insane! 



For example, Fall only lasted about a month, winter came late, winter didn’t want to end, polar vortex, record-breaking lows, and highs across the country, and now it's raining every other day in places like LA and LV. I used to live in LA and Las Vegas and my family still lives in Las Vegas so it’s not just the news saying it. We’re all noticing it. And I think we(at least most of us) agree that the weather is actually...strange.

It’s hard denying the facts. But the earth is heating up and though it may not purpose a real threat to us; it doesn’t necessarily mean we should continue to avoid the problem. 

I’ve been thinking (if any can get that song reference you’re my new best friend) but anyways I have been thinking about planet Earth. 

I just can’t seem to get it out of my head for more than a minute but don’t you think if you were the planet...don’t you think it would hurt? 

I mean it takes a lot of people and not ‘bad actions’ but certain kinds of actions to cause such a major effect like the ones we’re seeing today. 

I was talking to my roommate about this and I came up this this analogy:



Earth’s current condition is like a deep cut to us. It’s not that it’s unfixable but it needs the right care to be healed. 

I hear some people say it’s too late but if everything on Earth is alive and like us, we get hurt+ we get the proper care = healed. So, I think if we all (most of us are :)) give it a shot we can make a major difference and hopefully figure out how to completely reverse it. Although, I do believe (no science to back this up that I know of) that much like us too, the Earth can get scars. 

On another note, let's say that we can’t reverse it. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t stop anyway. I mean, after all, we are ruining our own air and water...wich in return damages our health and future generations.

Also, I know if I was ‘mother earth’ I would want the pain to stop; even if there was no healing the wound.

I don’t want this to be a negative post. So, let me shed some light on this topic. 

System 001 is kind of like a giant magnetic(not really a magnet) net that helps fishermen or in this case an Ocean cleanup tech crew, to collect the plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

The patch is located in between the Hawaiian Islands and California. 

They expect it to be able to pick up 50% of the garbage in 5 years. And that’s just the first machine they’ve made!

Not to mention Places such as Starbucks, Seaworld, Alaskan and American airlines, hotels like Hilton and Marriot UK, Disney, and so many more! Even California is thinking about banning plastic straws. 

That’s pretty freakin’ amazing!

So many people have already switched to a ‘no waste’ lifestyle and of course, you can switch as well!

I know after all of this, I will definitely be much more conscious of the waste I use. I’ll be starting my journey with calling off all straws(unless I forget...well just in the beginning, at least)! 

How do you or will you be helping planet earth in the future?
